# challenges

Some challenges to solve during the workshops.

Start with the challenge number 1 fizzbuzz. Good luck!

There are a lot of way to solve a challenge. The solutions provided are just examples.

## Environment set up

Some challenges, can be run in the Go Playground (the 3 firsts challenges for example).
For them, you don't need to install anything on your computer!

Later, you will need a better environment (to read a user input, or other files for example).

What you need to write Go code and run it on your computer:
- A tool to write your code (we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on you computer;

Don't hesitate to ask for help during a workshop if you have some trouble to install anything!

## Community help
